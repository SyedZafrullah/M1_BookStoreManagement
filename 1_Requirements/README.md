# **Book Store Management System**

## INTRODUCTION:

Book Store management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to customer needs. The system helps both customer and Admin (Book store Manager) to keep a constant track of all the books available in the Book Store. It allows both the admin and the customer to search for the desired book.

The project titled Book Store Management System is Book Store Management software for monitoring and controlling the availability of the books in the store. The project “Book Store Management System” is developed in C, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a Book Store like adding new books, searching books ,buying books if available, requesting unavailable books to the admin and deleting books.

This project “BOOK STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” gives us the complete information about the Book Store. We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. In this project we can provide the customer options like searching the books by title, author name, publisher and buy the book based on their requirement and request book if it is not available. We can issue the books to the customer by providing the total cost of the books. We can see the customer's requested books.

## Opportunities:
The LMS leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of book store systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. With an increasing move towards closed platforms (like Facebook, for example) and proprietary ecosystems (like Apple), libraries will be required to navigate these different spaces and ecosystems.

### Threats:
Book Stores now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some book stores don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.
